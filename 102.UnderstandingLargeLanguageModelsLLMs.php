All right, so welcome to the very interesting section

that is how LLM works.

So this whole agentic AI,AI and all the buzzwords that you hear in the market are basically all around the LLM.

So LLM stands for large Language model.

So in this particular video, I'll keep this particular video a, very beginner friendly and let's just understand what is an LLM.

In this particular section you're going to see what is

an LLM, how LLMs internally work,

what are vector embeddings,

what is tokenization,

what is attention is all you need.

White paper by Google.

So this is going to be a really,

really, really brain opening,

eye opening, videos section

where you will understand that how

internally the LLMs work.

So with that let's start

with the video.

So I'm pretty sure that you

have used ChatGPT, right?

Or maybe Gemini or maybe

Claude, any one of them.

And you in your day to day activity,

you like asking questions

to these LLM models.

Just for an example, let me just

quickly do a screen sharing.

So if you can see on my screen I have

something very familiar opened here.

That is a chart GPT.

Now to this chart GPT what

happens is when I say hi

magically it replies me hey piyush,

what can I help you with?

If I ask is, hey, what is 2 plus 2?

What you are going to notice is that

you are going to get an answer that

is two plus two equals to four.

So it feels like that

there is someone who is chatting

with you, right?

You are chatting with someone

and as this website says

that this is chat GPT.

Chat GPT means that you are

basically chatting with a GPT.

And what is GPT?

GPT is basically an LLM LLM okay,

*** LLM stands for Large Language model.So if you ask any question to these large language models, they give
you some output, right, based on how they have been trained.

For example if I ask him

what is, okay, what is an large,

what is a large language model?

And enter so what you are going

to notice is that it is actually

going to draft an answer for me.

A large language model is

an artificial intelligence system

trained to understand

number one, understand

and generate human language.

So these are some models, some

systems which are trained

to number one understand

the natural language and to generate
human language outputs.

So right now whatever I'm speaking,

you are able to hear me out.

Why?

Because you understand English

language, you understand what I'm

saying and based on that you are

also able to respond to me.

So these LLMs are basically

an AI systems which are trained

to do the same thing.

So if you see they are

already trained.

So the Chat GPT, the company

behind Chat GPT is OpenAI.

So OpenAI has actually trained these

models on whole Internet data.

All right, like Your tweets,

your LinkedIn posts, your

Facebook post, all that is used

in training of these data.

So what are these tokens and all we

will talk about this thing and what

happens is now based on that

training data, whenever you ask them

something, they give you the output

for that.

So basically Chat GPT is nothing.

GPT is the actual LLM,

the large language model with

which you are chatting.

And chat GPT.

GPT is not the only

and only LLM in the world.

There are even more LLMs.

For example, example here you

can see that this is a Gemini.

Gemini is again a large

language model by Google.

So all these big tech giant companies

are now playing on the data.

They scrape the data, they get

the data, they prepare something

known as training data set and then

they are training these LLMs.

Okay, so to this LLM, I can ask, hey,

what is an LLM

that is in, in the context of AI.

Okay, in the context of AI.

And I just do an enter.

So what you're going to notice is

does something, right, based on

whatever I have asked, it is now

thinking, okay, it is now thinking

something and this thinking and

all goes into what is in the

training data.

And now quickly you are going

to see some response.

So yeah, it is going

to take some time.

So of course, here's

a detailed explanation.

So LLM stands for

Large Language Model.

At its core, an LLM is

a sophisticated type of artificial

intelligence AI that has been

trained to understand, process

and generate human language.

So what you can understand

is basically the human

language is the main thing.

Whenever we talk to systems,

we always have to talk

in a structured manner.

Maybe you have to write a code in C,

maybe you have to write a code in C.

But using these LLMs, you

can actually talk

to the machine in a natural

language like we humans do.

So this is the main

USP of these LLMs.

So right now in the market,

there are lots and lots of LLMs.

There is OpenAI, there is GPT

GPT 3.5 GPT 3.5 Turbo GPT 4 GPT 4O

GPT GPT 03, mini GPT 03.

And from Gemini you have a lot

of models you can see here, right?

The list is very big actually.

2.5, 2.5 Pro.

There are some preview models.

There is a, 1.5 models.

Then there is some Claude, Claude

4 Claude Sonet, Claude 4 Pro.

A lot and lots of LLMs are there.

They are trained

on different data sets.

They have different capabilities,

different speed.

But at the end, the goal is

to understand the natural language

and generate the natural language,

which is, useful for us.

So this is the definition of LLM.

I'm not telling you that this is

the internal working of LLM.

This is just the definition

of an LLM.

In the next video we are going to

see how these LLMs internally work.

We will see some in depth guide that.

Okay, what happens when you

say, hey, what happens now?

How magically to this hey.

This LLM responds

with hey, again, push.

So this is what we are going


Important points :
LLMS -> Large language models 
Generally we have to write the code or structure langugeate to communcate with the system .
But with LLMS we can communicate with human language . these are trained to understand the human language 

1.LLM Meaning
LLM = Large Language Model.
AI system trained to understand and generate human language.
2.Examples
OpenAI → ChatGPT (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4 mini, etc.)
Google → Gemini models (1.5, 2.5, Pro versions, etc.)
Anthropic → Claude (Claude 4, Sonnet, Pro, etc.)
3.What They Do
Understand natural human language.
Generate human-like responses.
Allow humans to talk to machines in natural language (instead of coding in C, Java, etc.).
4.How They Work (high-level idea)
Trained on huge datasets (internet data: tweets, LinkedIn posts, articles, books, etc.).
When you type a prompt, the LLM uses training + probability to generate the most likely next words.
Example:
Input: “What is 2 + 2?”
Output: “4” (because it has seen and learned this pattern).
ChatGPT vs GPT
ChatGPT = Chat interface (app/website).
GPT = The actual LLM behind ChatGPT.
5.Core Idea
The USP (Unique Selling Point) of LLMs: You can talk to machines in human language.

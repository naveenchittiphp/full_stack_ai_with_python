All right, so in this particular

video, let's understand and deep

dive into the how LLMs work.


Now, the working of the LLM is
actually broken into many pieces,
but let give me a chance
to simplify all these things.

So with that, let's start
with the video.

So let's understand how LLMs work.
Okay?

Right now, what we have seen is that
whenever I ask this LLM something,

for example, hey, I get an answer.

So what is basically happening is,
let's understand,

let's say that this is an LLM, okay?
Right now, we don't know
what is happening inside.

The user gives an input, right?
So what do you have is you
basically have a, user.

So let's say that this is your user,
and user inputs something

that is hi to the LLM.
And in return,
in return you get a, response saying
something like, hey there.

Okay, hey there, how are you?
Question mark and stop.

So this is what the LLM is doing.

Now, the most exciting part is
that how this hi is getting

understood by this black box

thing right now, which we

don't know how it is working.

And somehow it is like giving

me these magical responses.

It is giving me these

magical responses.

Terminology Input tokens and output tokens : 
-------------
So let's get a terminology, set.
*** First of all, what the user inputs
is basically known as input tokens.

Okay?

So whatever is given to the LLM as
an input is named as input tokens.

Because now we are going
into the technical deep dive.
So these terms must be known.

*** And what you get as an output
is known as output tokens.

Okay?

So, so here if I go back,
this is my input tokens.
These are my output tokens.

Now, I know you might be

wondering, what are these tokens?

What is the meaning

of the word token?

I'll come to that in a while.

Now we, are charting with what we

are charting with GPT, right?

So let's say GPT.

Now, you know, the working

of the whole LLM is actually hidden

behind this word GPT.

GPT is such a brilliant word.

Let me break it through.

So if we have to see the full form

of GPT, GPT stands for generative.

Okay, Pre trained.

Okay, Pre trained.

Let me just scroll up a little bit.

Okay, Generative.

Pre trained.

And then you have transformer.

Now, what is basically

this full form?

This is a brilliant name given

by OpenAI to their LLM models.

If we break down this word,

number one word is generative.

Generative means that this

particular thing, this magical

thing, is generative in nature.

Whenever you give it an input, it

actually generates the output

for you see when you use Google, you

might have used Google, right?

Let me just go to the google.com.

so this is Google.

When you search something

on the Google, let's say if I want

to search what is, let's say jwks.

Okay.

It is in my history.

What you're going to notice is that

I actually get some relevant links.

Google is a search engine.

It is not generating content for

me, it is just helping me to search

how this searching is working.

It is working on the keywords

because my input query

has this JWKS as a keyword.

It is just indexing all

the websites and searching

for this word that is jwks.

But that is not the case here.

It is not searching something, it is

actually generating on the spot.

To prove my point that yes, it

is actually generating something,

I will just say hey,

from now onwards, from now onwards

address me as cute Piyushkar.

Okay, I.

I mean I, I didn't came up with some

good example but okay, let's say.

Okay now what you will understand is.

I know this is weird.

If I say hey, who am.

I.

Okay, now what you're going

to notice is that because

it has some instructions, it

is generating this text.

This text doesn't exist

on the Internet anywhere, right?

Based on my current input, it

actually is generating something.

That is why it is

known as generative.

So this is the nature.

Okay, so let's say that

this is the nature.

It is generative, not

searching nature.

Now pre trained.

See guys, to do something,

to generate something,

you need something, right?

How it is generative in nature.

Let's say I have told you it

is generative in nature.

But generating the content

on what basis?

On the basis of pre trained data.

Right?

Right now I am here teaching

you what LLM, correct?

I am generating this content.

This particular video

is generated by me.

But how do I know?

Because I have also

researched about it.

I have, I have read a lot of books

and articles around this thing.

So that means I am kind

of pre trained.

I have already taken the training

of the AI and that is from

that particular knowledge I am

able to generate this video.

So similarly, these LLMs, in order

to be generative, they have

to rely on some pre trained data.

They just don't give

you random outputs.

They actually are generative based

on the pre trained data.

So this is the nature, this is

on what basis they generate.

That is pre trained.

And the transformer.

The transformer is what?

It is actually a transformer.

The chart GPT Gemini, these

all are transformers.

This is basically its real reality.

Okay, I know now this

transformer is not clear.

Let me give you an example,

guys, what is this?

You will see a car.

I said, okay, a car.

Whenever you think about

a car, you basically imagine

something like this.

Okay guys, let me just

tell me one thing.

If I say sports car, okay,

what is the meaning of sports car?

You will say, hey Piyush,

this is actually two words.

Number one is sports,

which is the nature, okay?

Which is like the type of the car.

But what is a car?

A car.

A car is basically the real,

real object, right?

So it's basically a car which

who has a nature of sporty.

Similarly, this actually

a transformer which is generative

in nature and generative.

On what basis?

On the basis of pre training.

So this is how this

name is performed.

So every model out there, for

example, Gemini out there,

Claude out there, let's say

your, GPTs out there and any

other model, if you know, like

Mistral models out there, these

all are what?

These all are actually transformers.

These all are actually transformers.

Okay?

And these all are

actually transformers.

Based on what?

Based on some pre training data.

Okay, pre training data.

And the nature is

actually generative.

So if you think actually

OpenAI has given a really,

really, really nice name.

Imagine for example, you have

a company of cars name as Audi.

Now technically we all know

that Audi is a car brand.

But it is not obvious that Audi

is going to be a car brand.

Similarly, you have BMW, you

have, let's say Mercedes.

What if I open a new car company

and I name this car as Car?

Imagine the brand

name of my car is Car.

Now what happens is this

is a brilliant name.

This is a brilliant name

because at the end

of the day, Audi is also a car.

BMW is also a car.

Mercedes is also a car.

But I actually take, I have

trademarked the car

that my brand name is Car.

Car.

Why?

Because I am actually making car.

So this is going to be a brilliant

name for a car company, right?

Similarly for shoes, let's say

for shoes, you have a lot

of brands and shoes, right?

You have, let's say Adidas.

Okay, Adidas.

You have, let's say Puma,

you have more brands.

But what if I open a new shoe

brand and name it as Shoes?

So similarly, actually

GPT, the name GPT, I.e.

generative pretrained transformer

is actually same thing.

These all are GPTs.

Gemini is also GPT,

Claude is also GPT.

GPT is also GPT.

And Mistral is also GPT.

But you know the OpenAI

company again see the name OpenAI

generic name, right?

OpenAI is basically naming their

models as GPT because they are GPT

generative pre trained transformer.

Gemini is also GPT.

Claude is also a GPT.

But you know they have not spent any

time in thinking about the name.

They said hey you are a generative

pretend transformer.

So your name is generative

pre trained transformer.

It's similarly like saying

hey you are a car so your

brand name is also a car.

Hey you are a shoe.

So let me just name it as a shoe.

Okay so this is basically

a very brilliant name

for you know, OpenAI that has GPT

generative pre trained transformer.

So in the next particular video

let's understand what is this

transformer because generative

is clear, pretrained is clear.

What is this transformer?

So this actually comes from

a white paper of the Google which

we are going to talk about


Important points :
------------------
### üìå Important Points ‚Äì How LLMs Work
1. **User & Response Flow**
   * A user gives an **input** (e.g., ‚Äúhi‚Äù).
   * The LLM processes it and generates an **output** (e.g., ‚Äúhey there‚Äù).
   * This happens inside a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù that looks magical but is based on structured computation.

2. **Terminology**
   * **Input Tokens** ‚Üí User‚Äôs input broken into pieces (tokens).
   * **Output Tokens** ‚Üí Model‚Äôs generated response, also in tokens.
   * Tokens are the basic building blocks (words, subwords, or characters).
3. **GPT ‚Äì Full Form**
   * **G = Generative** ‚Üí Model can **generate** new text, not just search.
   * **P = Pre-trained** ‚Üí Model is trained on massive datasets (internet, books, articles) before being fine-tuned.
   * **T = Transformer** ‚Üí The deep learning architecture behind LLMs.
4. **Difference from Google Search**
   * **Google Search** ‚Üí Finds existing pages based on keywords.
   * **LLMs (GPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.)** ‚Üí Actually **generate new text** in real time, based on training.

5. **Generative Nature**
   * Can create answers that don‚Äôt exist anywhere online.
   * Example: If instructed to call you ‚ÄúCute Piyushkar,‚Äù it will generate responses accordingly.
6. **Pre-trained Nature**
   * Similar to a teacher preparing a lecture after reading books.
   * LLMs are trained on huge datasets first ‚Üí then able to generate useful responses.
7. **Transformer Nature**
   * ‚ÄúTransformer‚Äù is the deep learning model introduced by Google‚Äôs paper *‚ÄúAttention is All You Need‚Äù*.
   * All modern LLMs (GPT, Gemini, Claude, Mistral, etc.) are variations of transformer models.
8. **Why the Name GPT is Brilliant**
   * OpenAI directly named its model as what it actually is:
     **Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)**.
   * Just like calling a car company ‚ÄúCar‚Äù or a shoe company ‚ÄúShoes.‚Äù
   * Other companies (Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, Mistral) are also transformers, but OpenAI trademarked the generic name.
Would you also like me to create a **shorter 5-point summary version** (like for quick slides) in addition to this detailed one?
